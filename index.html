    <h1>Who am I ?</h1>
    <p>
        I am a normal human who is just searching for the truth.
         I am currently lost and depressed, trying to find the real purpose of life. 
         The voices in my head are asking, Who are we? Why was I created? And what will happen after death?
          Is it a blank screen? Is it the end? Is Islam a big lie? Did the creator forget about us?
           I can't accept that I might sleep and never wake up again, leaving behind the people I love,
            the pleasures I have, or the money I make.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd rather rot in hell than be gone forever; however, as human beings, there are some facts that 
        we must accept; it doesn't matter whether we like it or not. All I know is that I'll do my best 
        to become a stronger and happier person who is more successful, and I won't give up because I 
        truly believe in myself. We'll do it, Omar. We'll do it, bro!
